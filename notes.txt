TODO:

Write the data to a longer buffer that wraps.

Correlate the number of zcs with the pitch. Record some data somehow. Or 
    write bits of waveform to the display.


Optimum frame size that allows us to read the entire frame during one IMU sampling interval.

Core 0:
DONE Spool the raw X data into a buffer.
DONE Run a LPF on that filter.
DONE Remove zero offset with a HPF.
DONE Zero crossing detector that is noise immune:
Send a message to core 1 when zero crossing is detected.

Core 1:
DONE Count the number of zero crossings in a second and display it.


Initialize tables of 0/1 strobe bands. Initially just one table.
Start a timer.
Calculate phase based on the timer and reference pitch.
Read the strobe bands based on that phase, copying them into a display buffer.
Throw the display buffer at the LCD.
