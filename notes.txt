TODO:


From the IMU data sheet, I think X is axis we are interested in for side to side motions.

Core 0:
Spool the raw X data into a circular buffer.
Run a LPF on that filter.
When it crosses zero, send a message to core 1.

Core 1:
Initialize tables of 0/1 strobe bands. Initially just one table.
Start a timer.
Calculate phase based on the timer and reference pitch.
Read the strobe bands based on that phase, copying them into a display buffer.
Throw the display buffer at the LCD.
