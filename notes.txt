Resolder the wires with heat shrink sleaving.

FIFO setup (data sheet chapter 8):
    Disable all sensors.
    Enable using FIFO_CTRL register, including HWM so that INT2 is generated.
    Enable accelerometer.
    To read:
        CTRL9: send command 0x0D; This automatically sets FIFO_rd_mode bit to 1 in FIFO_CTRL.
        Read from FIFO_DATA (XL, XH, YL, YH, ZL, ZH, etc).
        Clear FIFO_rd_mode bit in FIFO_CTRL.

Beware register auto increment when reading data from the FIFO.

Result FIFO via ctrl 9 before we start.
Is the command to read FIFO actually correct? 5 or D?
Do we need to reset interrupts in the ARM? In PIO?
